    <h3>Projects and Interests</h3>
    <ul aria-label="projects and interests">
        <li><a href="https://blindgumption.com">BlindGumption</a> is where I like to explore building accessible apps. Code for the site can be found at <a href="https://github.com/blindgumption"> BlindGumption on github </a>
            <p>BlindGumption started as a static HTML site served by Nginx from a droplet in DigitalOcean.
                In the summer of 2023, I wanted to change it completely.
                <a href="mainBlindGumptionOriginalContent/index.html">The original content from blindgumption.com</a>
                now exists only on my github pages.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://pypi.org/project/domible/">domible</a> - a project to render accessible HTML elements from Python classes.
            The <a href="https://github.com/joeldodson/domible/">source code for domible</a> is open source on github.
            <p> There is an extra with domible, <code>dicli.py</code>.
                It's a typer based CLI with different use cases of domible.
                Some of the examples do a bit of web scraping and take a while to run.
                I'm adding links to the output here in case I want/need to quickly show any examples. </p>
                <ul aria-label="dicli examples">
                    <li><b><a href="dicliOutput/htmlElements.html">Tables of HTML Elements</a></b> -
                    These tables are created using the builders in domible with data scraped from MDN.</li>
                </ul>

        <li><a href="pythonandaccessibility"> Python and Accessibility </a> - based on the 'slides' for talk I gave at PyBay 2022.
        I'll be making occasional changes to this content and I didn't want it to get out of sync with the PyBay 2022 talk. </li>

    <h2>Random Resources</h2>
    <p> This is the default case in the switch statement of h2 headings.
        I often find myself reading or listening to something and think, ah, cool, that'll be a great addition to my tool set.
        Then, (nearly) inevitably, I forget the details.
        Or, this is a great resource, I'll bookmark it.
        Then it is lost in my sea of bookmarks of things I want to remember.
    </p>
    <p>Well, no more of that.
        This section will be a list of documents where I'll track the things I <b><em>really</em></b> want to remember.
    </p>
    <ul aria-label="Random Resources">
        <li><b><a href="commands.html">CLI commands</a></b> -
            IN here are various commands I've run in the past and often had to search again for the specifics.
            Now I'll have those specifics saved here and not have to wade through help files with a screen reader (harder to skim).
        </li>
        <li><b><a href="containers.html">Learning About Containers</a></b> -
            I need to understand deeper details of containers.
            And, I need to learn more about Kubernetes (k8s).
            My plan is to container-ize my blindgumption site and setup a CICD pipeline using github actions.
            This page has links and notes on what I've been learning, and where I've been learning it, regarding container relevant technologies.
        </li>
        <li><b><a href="webdev.html">Articles I Should Read for Web Development</a></b> -
            In here are links I would put in my bookmarks under something like "interesting reading for web development".
            I'm adding them here hoping others will find them useful.
        </li>
        <li><b><a href="learnPython.html">Somewhat Obscure Resources for Learning Python</a></b> -
            This has some non-obvious places to go to learn Python
