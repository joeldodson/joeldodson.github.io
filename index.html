    <h2>Random Resources</h2>
    <p> This is the default case in the switch statement of h2 headings.
        I often find myself reading or listening to something and think, ah, cool, that'll be a great addition to my tool set.
        Then, (nearly) inevitably, I forget the details.
        Or, this is a great resource, I'll bookmark it.
        Then it is lost in my sea of bookmarks of things I want to remember.
    </p>
    <p>Well, no more of that.
        This section will be a list of documents where I'll track the things I <b><em>really</em></b> want to remember.
    </p>
    <ul aria-label="Random Resources">
        <li><b><a href="commands.html">CLI commands</a></b> -
            IN here are various commands I've run in the past and often had to search again for the specifics.
            Now I'll have those specifics saved here and not have to wade through help files with a screen reader (harder to skim).
