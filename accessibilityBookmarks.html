        <h1>Accessibility Bookmarks </h1>
        <p> These are links to articles I've run accross in various ways (initially, from channels in the a11y slack group).
            I'm saving them here to access them from anywhere and maybe others will find this list useful.
        </p>
        <p> I could fill this list with dozens of articles from blogs of people I've already mentioned in accessibility resources.
            That might be overwhelming, too much to keep updating, and mostly duplicate their blog listings.
            My plan for this page is links to articles I can't easily find by searching someones' blog.
            Though realistically, I might add links here and later realize the author is a prolific accessibility blogger and add their blog link to the resources page.
            So don't be shocked to find links to blogs here that could easily be found by searching a bloggers list of articles.

                Get deep into how accessibility works at the programming level.
