    <h1> Relevance to Python </h1>
    <ul>
        <li>Okay, Python isn't very popular for building UIs </li>
        <li>Though, with frameworks like Django, Flask, and simlar others, there's plenty of HTML being served probably via rendering templates</li>
        <lie>And there are existing packages to build UIs in Python, making those UIs accessible is a struggle at best</lie>
    </ul>
    <h2>Cool New Options for 'building UIs in Python</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>BeeWare - cross platform desktop and mobile apps using native components</li>
        <li>Flet - also cross platform desktop and mobile based on Flutter </li>
        <li> PyScript - running Python in the browser using WASM, maybe can use it in Electron or Tauri eventually as well</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>The Future has Potential </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>For BeeWare, Using native components is a great start toward achieving accessibility </li>
        <li>For PyScript, accessibility is fairly well understood in the browser (there are issues, that's a different talk)</li>
        <li>Frameworks can encapsulate many details of accessibility.  Developers will still need to understand the ideas though and be aware of what is and isn't provided by the frmework</li>
    </ul>
