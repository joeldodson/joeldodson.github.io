    <h1> Accessibility Resources</h1>
    <p>In here you will find links to many different resources related to accessibility.
        I've tried to group them under headings but some fall into more than one category.
        In some cases I'll list the same resource multiple times if it's clearly part of multiple categories.
        If there is only a tangential relationship, I'll probably not relist the reference.
    </p>
    <p>In an attempt to keep this page from getting stale or opinionated, there is little to no detail beyond high level descriptions, where I felt it could be useful.
        Please click through the links and you should have the most current information directly from the sources themselves.
    </p>
    <p>And this page is very far from exhaustive.  
        That's not my goal, or realistic.
        If you need support locally or are looking for something fairly specific, do a web search (bing it ;) ).
    </p>
    <h2>Standards and Guidelines</h2>
    <p>Specifications for accessibility for the web as well as desktop and mobile applications are being developed at the 
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/">World Wide Web Consortium (w3c) within the Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI)</a>.  
        It's full of great resources; here are some links to start your journey:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/">Accessibility Fundamentals Overview</a> -
        links to articles, videos, tutorials, standards,and more</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</a> -
            many regulations are based on meeting  WCAG 2.1, level AA requirements</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/atag/">Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG)</a> - 
            authoring tools should be accessible themselves AND generate accessible content</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/uaag/">User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG)</a> - 
            for developers of applications rendering web content, e.g., browsers, plugins, video players, readers</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/aria/">Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA)</a> - 
            ARIA can be powerful, be careful, it should be used only when necessary, and well understood.
            If I were reviewing a pull request and saw, for example, a div with ARIA attributes, I would require an explanation of why a standard HTML component was not used instead.</li>
            <li><a href="https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/">ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG)</a> - 
            If you need to use ARIA, and there will be times you do, start with the APG.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Learn About Accessibility</h2>
    <p>Links here are to resources to learn about accessibility in general including how to develop accessible software applications.
        Many of the sources here are free (maybe after registering at their website) and some are commercial.
        Who knows what the future holds WRT business plans, though I'd be surprised if many of these resources changed their access policies.
        I might add some text with the link depending on my experience with the resource.
        Lack of description for a resource only means I don't know much about it, not whether it's useful or its quality.
    </p>
    <ul aria-label="resources for learning">
        <li><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility">Accessibility on MDN</a> -
            MDN (Mozilla Developer Network) has great docs for web development in general.
            Part of that is they have accessibility included throughout the documentation.
            They also have a great section dedicated to accessibility.
            MDN is free, and probably always will be.
            They have recently introduced a $5/month plan with some extra features but it's mostly a good way to support MDN.
            I highly recommend subscribing if you can afford it and if you plan to do a lot of web development.
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://dequeuniversity.com">Deque University</a> -
            There are many courses with quizes in a variety of topics.
            I'm adding some commentary here because I hve full access to Deque University through their scholarship program.
            If you can afford it, or if your company provides a budget for education, Deque is a good option.
            It's also a good place if you want to study for certification exams from the <a href="#iaap-anchor">IAAP</a>.
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://webaim.org/">WebAIM: Web Accessibility In Mind</a> - 
            WebAIM does a lot of cool stuff.
            They provide a variety of paid for services and have a lot of free resources as well.
            They also do interesting surveys and run accessibility tests across millions of sites.
            Under the resources link you'll find a plethora of information on a variety of accessibility topics.
            I recommend spending time looking through their site (an exercise for the reader). 
        </li>
        <li><a href="https://hadley.edu/">Hadley Vision Resources</a> - 
            Hadley is probably better understood as a place for learning about vision loss, how to work with it and help those affected by it.
            I list it here because in 2017, when I was learning to use my phone and laptop, I listened to several lessons from Hadley.
            Back then I think it was Hadley School for the Blind.
            It sounds like there has been some rebranding since then, or maybe this is a separate division.
            It's probably not the best place for learning how to develop an accessible web or mobile application, but probably good for learning about blindness and how to live with it.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2> Blindness Organizations </h2>
    <p> I don't know about the politics of these organizations though have heard opinions expressed.
        I'm going to steer clear of any commentary and simply list the URLs.
        Listing here is only an acknowledgement of existence, nothing regarding my opinions .
        And the lists are alphabetical (WRT American English), so no inferences.
        Though International is listed first, then country headings are also alphabetical.
    </p>
    <h3>International</h3>
    <ul aria-label="International Organizations">
        <li><a href="https://www.euroblind.org/">European Blind Union</a></li>
        <li><a id="iaap-anchor" href="https://www.accessibilityassociation.org/">International Association of Accessibility Professionals</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://worldblindunion.org/">World Blind Union</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Canadian Based</h3>
    <ul aria-label="Canadian Organizations">
        <li><a href="https://cnib.ca">Canadian National Institue for the Blind</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h3>United States Based</h3>
    <ul aria-label="United States Organizations">
        <li><a href="https://acb.org">American Council of the Blind</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://afb.org">American Foundation for the Blind</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://nfb.org">National Federation of the Blind</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Accessibility Focused Companies</h2>
    <p>As with organizations, there is intentionally little or no text with these links.
        I don't (as of 2022-09-15) have experience working with any of these companies.
        If you are in need of accessibility services, like with engaging with any company, do your research to find what meets your needs.
    </p>
    <ul aria-label="accessibility focused companies">
        <li><a href="https://deque.com/">Deque Systems</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://makeitfable.com/">Fable</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.funka.com/en">Funka</a> - Based in Sweden</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.levelaccess.com/">Level Access</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://perkinsaccess.org/">Perkins Access</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://www.pac.bz/">Prime Access Consulting</a></li>
        <li><a href="https://webaim.org">WebAIM</a></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Testing</h2>
    <p> I hesitated adding a testing section as any of the companies listed above will do accessibility testing.  
        They all have different approaches and different models of engagement/partnership.
        I did run across a link though that didn't fit anywhere else, so now we have a testing section.
    </p>
    <p> If you're looking for someone to help test your digital assets, the companies above might be a good starting list.
        Though you might be better served by an individual consultant or searching for local agencies. 
        As always, an internet search can be helpful 
        (be careful though you don't go with the company with the best Search Engine Optimization (SEO) vs the best accessibility provider for your needs).
    </p>
    <ul aria-label="testing resources">
        <li><a href="http://a11y.com">a11y.com</a> - 
        I don't know who runs this site.
    It's kind of cool, probably does web scraping and static analysis.
If you care, heads up the URL is NOT https.  Only http worked for me.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Feedback?</h2>
    <p>Do you have suggestions for additions to this page?  Or think something is misrepresented?
        Please <a href="https://github.com/joeldodson/joeldodson.github.io/issues">create an issue</a> in the repo and be clear it is for the Accessibility Resources.
        I assume you could find an email address for me, and I might reply if you do.
        It would be helpful though for others reading this page to have discussions of its content tracked in the repo.
    </p>

    <p><b><i>Thanks for your time and interest in accessibility.  Cheers!</i></b></p>
