		<h1>Notes From BlindGumption</h1>
		<p>
			The notes section is a place for me to keep track of how I've done things, 
		 resources I've found useful along the way, 
		 and general thoughts I might want to record throughout this journey.
			</p> 
			<p>
			I spent a lot of time thinking of how to structure these notes.  
			I decided I'd better just pick a structure and go with it.  So notes are broken down into three categories:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>
<a href="developingBG/index.html">Developing and Running BlindGumption</a> -- 
					this will contain notes regarding all elements of getting BlindGumption going, and keeping it going.  Click through for more details. 
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="thoughts/index.html">Thoughts from Me, BlindGumption</a> --
			this is where I'll record various thoughts I've had along this journey.  
		 Thoughts will include brief explanations of why I chose a particular solution or maybe some reflections on life in general. 
		 No politics.  Well, maybe some dry social commentary if it's begging to be written.
	</li>
	<li>
		<a href="resources/index.html">Resources I Find Helpful</a> --
	This might end up being one long index.html file though there might be some articles.  It's mostly a place for me to record links of places I find  interesting and useful.
I'll add some text to explain very briefly why a link is included and you can decide whether it's worth clicking through.
	</li>
</ul>
