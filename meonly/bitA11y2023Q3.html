        <h1>Analysis of Udemy for BIT A11y Course, 2023-08</h1>
        <p> Udemy is a SPA (Single Page Application), or at least parts of it are.
            This results in URLs being a bit odd in places.
            For example, to get to the signup page, I clicked a button to open a side panel.
            Then I clicked on the signup button.
            As you can see below, this resulted in query parameters being inserted in the URL.
        </p>
        <p>Update, 2023-09-20, FWIW -
            the signup now appears to be a link on the main page, the side panel seems to be gone.
            The link I follow is still the same for signup, including all the query parameters.
            Maybe they got rid of the side panel.
        </p>

                <p> This is the main page for Udemy.

                <p>I got to this link from "Contact Us" from the main Udemy page.
                    It's an odd title for the contact us page.

                    And at least on 2023-08-24,
                    the h1 heading had the text "en-us".
                    I suspect there's a bug on the page.

                <p>This is the result of searching for courses on the website testing tool "playwright".
                    I'm mostly curious how they markup the search results,
                    especially how well it works for single letter navigation.

        <h2>Successes and Failures for Perceivable</h2>
        <h3>Successes for Perceivable</h3>
        <p> I'm calling it done with only two examples of successes for perceivable for these 10 pages.
            Being totally blind, I'm not sure how to test items like contrast, reflow, and text spacing with only a screen reader.
            I also didn't want to go to each page with form elements to collect input
            and list each one as successfully meeting 1.3.5, Identify Input Purpose.
            Likewise listing each page where graphics all had well done alt attributes as independent examples of success
            seem to not be within the spirit of the assignment.
        </p>
        <p> I guess what I'm concluding is these pages are, for the most part, perceivable.
            As you can see below, not perfect, but nothing critically wrong.
        </p>

                As I type 'g' to go to the next graphic, I hear a very useful description read from the screen reader.

            <li>Description: The main page of Udemy appears to have a carousel used to group courses.
                It's not clear what those groupings are using only audio feedback from a screen reader.
                Each page in the carousel has multiple tabs for what sounds like different programming languages.
                There are previous and next buttons to navigate the carousel.
                I've tried the buttons but am almost completely lost as to where I am after moving a carousel page.

            <li>Description: This is another carousel failure.
                Instead of the previous and next buttons being next to each other, as I usually find them on carousels,
                the previous button is before the content
                and the next button is after the content of the carousel.
                Pressing either button gives no indication of any changes to the page.
                <p>After pressing the previous button, the content below changes.
                    After pressing the next button, the content above changes.

                The "overlay" appears to be at or near the bottom of the page and there is a close button.
                The video is a person giving a testimony of the role Udemy had played in their life.
                It's possible there is closed captioning of the video, but there does not appear to be any transcript available.

                I know to go to the h1 heading to hear how many results were found.
                Immediately after the h1 heading is a toggle button labeled
                "Close filter panel" or "Open filter panel"
                ostensibly based on the state of the filter panel.
                I tried to close the filter panel by activating the button to go directly to the first search result.
                The filter panel seemed to still be open.
                I activated the button again and the filter panel state appeared unchanged.
                Regardless the label I hear for that button, the filter panel is there and it takes several key presses to get passed it. </li>

                The end of each course description has a button with label, "Show course details."Nothing in the label associates the button with the course name.
                <p>I initially had this as a 2.4.4 Link Purpose violation as the label is missing context.
                    I realized 2.4.4 is specific to links.
                    2.4.6 is not well defined in WCAG 2.1 itself
                    but has slightly more in the understanding section indicating lack of clarity could be a violation.

        <h3>Failures for Understandable</h3>
        <p> As you can see, I have only 2 failures for understandable.
            In general, Udemy is quite accessible regarding navigation and understanding what is what and where I am.
            I even navigated into some of the free course materials, not the links I have listed above.
            It was easy to find and navigate the video player,
            including setting playback to 2x.
        </p>
        <p>I look forward to trying the testing automation tools to see
            what they come up with that I missed.</p>

            <li> Success Criteria Identifier: 3.3.1 </li>
            <li>Description: This might be wrong, or a usability vs accessibility issue.
                Here's my reasoning.
                <p>On the signup page, I enter an invalid email format, e.g., joel.gmail.com.
                    The submit button is enabled so I activate it.
                    NVDA reads to me the problem with the email field, even going so far to say it's missing the '@' and my focus is placed in the edit field for email.
                    This is all great so far.'
                </p>
                <p>What I'm calling out as the violation is I cannot find that error message anywhere on the page after I'm placed back in the email edit field.
                    I go back into browse mode and look around the page, no indication of an error.
                    Even next to the edit field, still containing the invalid email text, there's no indication of an error.
                    I check the source of the document and there's nothing hidden or invisible with the error message.
                </p>
                <p>The success criteria says the error "is described to the user in text."
                    Technically I guess that's true. NVDA was able to read the text to me.
                    But if I didn't hear it, or didn't understand it, and that text is nowhere on the page, is that a violation?
                    Seems like a cognition failure if the user cannot find and re-read the error.

            <li>Description: I'm listing this on the main Udemy page, it's the same for all occurences of the Categories component.
                <p>Categories mostly acts like a button.
                    NVDA calls it out as a button and single letter navigation 'b' lands on it.
                    It's inconsistent though with button activation.
                    If I arrow to the component, I hear "clickable, button, collapsed, Categories".
                    In general, the space bar and enter keys do not expand the section.
                    I have found in some cases though the section is expanded with one of those keys.
                    I have not gone in depth to determine a fully repeatable way to reproduce this behavior.
                </p>
                <p>If I navigate to the Categories component using the tab key,I always get the announcement,
                    "clickable, Categories, button, expanded" from NVDA.
                    (The expand on focus has already been logged as a 3.2.1 failure.)
                </p>
                <p>The HTML from the Categories component is:
                    <code><pre>
    &lt;div class&equals;&ldquo;browse-nav-module--placeholder-header-button--mKoRf&rdquo; id&equals;&ldquo;u13-popper-trigger--1&rdquo; aria-expanded&equals;&ldquo;false&rdquo; tabindex&equals;&ldquo;0&rdquo;&gt;Categories&lt;/div&gt;

                    I suspect there is some buggy CSS and JavaScript somwhere manipulating that class.

            <li>Description: There are a set of "buttons" on the Udemy for Business page.
                I'll focus on the "What we do" component.
                <p> The "What we do" button acts like a button.
                    NVDA reads out "button" when I navigate to it.
                    Single letter navigation 'b' lands on the component.
                    But the space and enter keys have no effect.
                </p>
                <p>The code when I reveal source (ctrl+u in Chrome) shows the following element:
                    <code><pre>
    &lt;a href="javascript:void(0);" class="section-header disabled" aria-haspopup="true" aria-expanded="false" aria-label="What we do" role="button" tabindex="0">What we do&lt;/a>
                </pre></code>
                    What the heck is all that?
                </p>
                <p> We're starting with an anchor element to implement a button.
                    The href of <code>"javascript:void(0);"</code> causes the link to do nothing
                    (according to the folowing Stack Overflow article:
                    https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1291942/what-does-javascriptvoid0-mean).
                    And there is a role="button" and some other ARIA Iincluding a redundant label and tabstop.
                </p>
                <p> I'd argue this not only failes 4.1.2, it also fails 2.1.1 and fails the idea of
                    "no ARIA is better than bad ARIA." </p>

            <li>Description: I wanted to determine if the "Show course details" buttons on the main page
                failed keyboard usage due to a 4.1.2 failure.
                Due to the massive size of the HTML (over 400,000 characters),
                I was unable to get the chrome dev tools to find the "buttons"
                and trying to look through the code from ctrl-u (reveal source)
                caused chrome to stop responding for a very long time.
                <p> I tried using playwright, a tool for web scraping for dynamically generated sites).
                    Using the chromium engine, I could get what seemed like the fully evaluated page for udemy.com.
                    Using get_by_role("button"), I could find 34 alleged buttons.
                    Many of those buttons were not visible on the page,
                    and a majority of them did not have text_content or inner_text.
                </p>
                <p> I suspect the buttons were all labeled using some aria-labelledby
                    based on some hidden item (maybe a span with an id).
                    I don't know playwright well enough yet, and more the real issue,
                    I was running out of time, to go through and find all the
                    attributes to correlate some id with some aria-labellledby.
                </p>
                <p>I'm still going to list all those "Show course details" buttons as 4.1.2 failures
                    partly because they fail functionality they should have based on NVDA
                    considering them as buttons.
                    And due to not being able to find them when searching all "button" roles with playwright.
