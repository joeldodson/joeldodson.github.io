        <h1>Resources for Learning Python</h1>
        <p> As I wander around the internets, trying to find answers to questions,
            I occasionally run across great resources in obscure places.
            This is a place to keep track of ones I've found related to learning Python.
        </p>
        <p> There are no shortages of books and websites dedicated to learning Python.
            The official documentation on the
            <a href="https://python.org">main Python site</a>
            is definitely a great start.
            There's a lot there though and might be overwhelming.
        </p>
        <p> Here are some other resources I found interesting.
            Hopefully the age better than milk.
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><b><a href="https://realpython.com">Real Python</a></b> --
                Real Python has a large library of courses and articles including quizzes and learning paths.
                The video courses are somewhat accessible using the transcripts and following along with the code from github.
                I generally prefer to find information in the articles.
            </li>
            <li><b><a href="https://merely-useful.tech/py-rse/">Merely Useful</a></b> --
                This is a course developed by researchers for people getting in to research.
                It starts with some nice introductory material regarding command line interfaces.
                It's targeting data research but has good general points.
            </li>
            <li><b><a href="https://py-pkgs.org">Python Packages Book</a></b> --
                This is an open source book written by two researchers.
                It's the best general resource I've found for how to manage, package, and publish a Python package.
                It starts with a cookie cutter (and explains what that is) to initiate your project.
                It takes you all the way through to CI/CD with github actions.</li>
