    <h1> Accessibility References </h1>
    <p>In here you will find links to many different resources related to accessibility.
        I've tried to group them under headings but some fall into more than one category.  
        In some cases I'll list the same resource multiple times if it's clearly part of multiple categories.
        If there is only a tangential relationship, I'll probably not relist the reference. 
    </p>
    <p>In an attempt to keep this page from getting stale or opinionated, there is little to no detail beyond high level descriptions, where I felt it could be useful.
        Please click through the links and you should have the most current information directly from the sources themselves.
    </p>
    <h2> Blindness Organizations </h2>
    <p> I don't know about the politics of these organizations though have heard opinions expressed.  
        I'm going to steer clear of any commentary and simply list the URLs.
        Listing here is only an acknowledgement of existence, nothing regarding my opinions .
        And the lists are alphabetical (WRT American English), so no inferences.
        Though International is listed first, then country headings are also alphabetical.
    </p>
