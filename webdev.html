        <h1>Articles I Should Read for Web Development </h1>
        <p> This page is kind of something instead of bookmarks.
            There's a higher barrier to add links here than simply 'ctrl-d' in my browser.
            My expectation is this higher barrier will act as a filter to eliminate much of the cruft in my bookmarks.
        </p>
        <p> I'm starting this page with no sub-headers.
            Links might end up in some logical grouping.
            If it looks like it could be useful, I'll add headings to indicate certain topics.

            <li><b><a href="https://simplelocalize.io/blog/posts/what-is-cors/">What is CORS?</a></b> - 
                I've often  heard the term CORS and knew I should learn about it.
                Then this article showed up in a weekly programmers email.
                There's more depth in this
